# PhonebookwithPerlScripts
This AJAX/Perl scripts project checks to make sure that a first name, last name, and phone number are entered. 
It also does a basic check of the phone number and email address.

The objective/specs for this project were as follows:

Create an HTML document that uses AJAX and the Perl scripts from the lesson. 
The code in the HTML document should check to make sure there is a first name, last name, and phone number for each new entry. 
It should also ensure that the phone number entered is either seven or ten digits. If it is seven digits, a default area code should automatically be added to the front of the number. 
Additionally any email address entered should include both an @ symbol as well as a dot .
